# How to Contribute

## License

STDPipe is released under the MIT license, which means that you are allowed to modify the code for your own purposes, as long as you retain our [copyright notice](https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

However, we would love to grow the stdpipe community, and integrate improvements directly into our [code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe).

## Including your changes

To make a code contribution to the project, follow these steps (which
are outlined in more detail in [this GitHub
guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)):

1. Make a fork of the [STDPipe repository](https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe)
2. Clone your fork, and add `upstream` (`git@github.com:karpov-sv/stdpipe`) as a remote
3. Create a new branch and add your feature
4. Submit a pull request (PR) on GitHub

The other developers will provide feedback, and you may push updates
into the same branch (which will also update your pull request), until
the Continuous Integration tests pass and reviewers agree that it
should be merged (see "Process Guidelines: Reviews" below).

For a more detailed explanation of the open contribution process, see
the [scikit-image contributors' guide](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/contribute.html).
We follow a very similar process; some guidance follows below.

## Bug Reports

While we appreciate code changes, it is also very helpful simply to
know when STDPipe does not function correctly.  Please [file any
issues](https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe/issues) you run across.

If possible, provide:

1. A full description of your environment, including operating system,
   and Python version.
2. A minimal way to reproduce the problem you see; these can be either
   a set of instructions, or a script.
