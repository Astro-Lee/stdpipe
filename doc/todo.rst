TODO list
=========

*STDPipe* development is ongoing - that means we have not yet implemented all the things we want. So here is an (obviously) incomplete list of these things:

- Improve the documentation and tutorials to better demonstrate the usage of *STDPipe* in real world
- Create unit testing infrastructure!
- Implement some cache control routines that would control the disk usage by Astroquery-based routines, as well as Pan-STARRS image download ones
- Re-work the local caching of original Pan-STARRS images to both reduce their sizes (e.g. downscale them if you do not need them in full resolution for your analysis) and make downloads more reliable if something fails
- Implement some sort of limiting magnitude estimation routine for convenience
- ...


If you have some other ideas in mind about what might be implemented
